# digit-classifier
This is a handwritten digit classifying neural network written in Python in a Jupyter Notebook

It follows the amazing tutorial written at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html.
Although it would be easy to simply copy and paste the code, I highly recommend (and am myself) taking
the time to actually understand what's going on, writing out pieces that don't make sense, and
searching for additional resources when necessary.
